## How to set up this app on your local machine

These instructions will get you a copy of this project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

To install this project on your local machine, you need first to clone the repository `https://github.com/patricktunez123/aka-youtube.git` or download the zip file and once this is set up you're gonna need NODEJS installed on your machine.

## Installing

The installation of this application is straightforward, After cloning this repository to your local machine, cd into it using your terminal and run the following command

- yarn

It will install all the node_modules for the project.

## Set environment variables

After successfully installed all packages the next step is to set up environment variables, in root folder create a file and call it .env and open this file in any text editor of your choice then paste the following into it (Do not forget to edit it accordingly):

- REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=put-your-YouTube-API-KEY-here

## After the project set up then use these available scripts according to what you need to do with the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Attention! by running this script make sure you know what you are doing!**
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
